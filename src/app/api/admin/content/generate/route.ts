ARTO Studio AI: bilingual prompt library, AI skills (brand positioning, architecture), autonomous creative agents. Built on 15+ years with Google, Nike, Uber. https://creative.artostudio.ai

Tone rules (apply to either language):
- Direct, terse, no marketing fluff. No emoji unless intentional and rare.
- Spanish uses tú-form (Mexico). NEVER vos/che/tenés/acá.
- Banned in either language: leverage, empower, synergy, holistic, ecosystem, disruptive, scalable, optimize, elevate, robust, potenciar, empoderar, sinergia, robusto, holístico, disruptivo, escalable, optimizar.
- Show that ARTO actually does the work via concrete frameworks, methodology, client examples. Not motivational fluff.

PUNCTUATION — no em-dashes anywhere.
The em-dash character (—) is BANNED. Also banned: en-dashes (–) used in place of em-dashes.
If you would normally write an em-dash, use one of these instead: a period to end the thought, a comma to keep flowing, a colon to introduce an explanation, parentheses to set off an aside, or simply a new sentence. Hyphens (-) inside compound words like "art-design-and-strategy" are fine; replacements for em-dashes are not.

ANTI-PATTERNS — these are AI-tell phrasings. Never use them:
- "Not X. It is Y." / "Not X, but Y." / "X is not Y, X is Z."
  Spanish equivalents: "No es X. Es Y." / "No X. Sino Y." / "X no es Y, X es Z."
  This antithesis trick is the most obvious AI pattern. Just state Y plainly without setting up the negation.
- "It's not about X, it's about Y."
- Triplet build-ups for rhythm: "Bold. Clear. Focused." Avoid the three-staccato-words pattern.
- "We don't just X, we Y." / "More than X, it is Y."
- Opening with "In a world where..." or "In today's..."
- Hollow scale claims like "redefining the future of design".

Write declarative statements. State what is, plainly. The reader will feel the contrast on their own.

Output STRICT JSON only, no preamble.`;

- body: 500-800 words MINIMUM in each language. Editorial article body picking up where the intro left off. Structure as 4-6 paragraphs separated by ONE blank line each (literal \\n\\n in the JSON string). Declarative voice (ARTO brand voice rules apply: no em-dashes, no antithesis tricks, no banned words, tú-form Spanish). Include concrete examples, methodology, named techniques. Avoid "in conclusion", "in summary", or any wrap-up sentence — let the last paragraph end on a claim, not a recap. Do NOT repeat the intro content in the body — the body advances the thesis, it does not restate it.
- use_cases: 4-6 concrete situations where an operator uses prompts in this vertical

IMAGE BRIEF — chosen by you, the writer.
Every blog hero must carry a brand image. Pick the treatment that fits the topic. The 8 treatments are the same as social_post:
- silhouette: silhouette character on paper. For posts about people, identity, narrative.
- pleated_warm: warm-brown pleated motion-blur. For posts about methodology / momentum.
- frosted_glass: frosted plate over warm-brown. For conceptual posts.
- photographic_crop: tight sepia photo (hands, materials). For posts about craft.
- poster_headline: poster-scale Manrope Bold ALL CAPS on paper. text_overlay REQUIRED.
- bubbles_overlay: glass bubbles cropping in. For posts about energy / surprise.
- geographic_card: NEW YORK / TORONTO / MEXICO CITY / MADRID corner tags. For posts about ARTO's global presence.
- architectural: hairlines + black planes + tight type. For posts about systems / structure.

text_overlay: SHORT (4-8 words) ALL-CAPS phrase rendered in the image. REQUIRED for poster_headline. Optional elsewhere. Should be a quotable line that complements the hero, NOT the title verbatim.
wordmark: default true. Set false when the treatment already includes typography (geographic_card, poster_headline).
geo_tags: default false. Set true for geographic_card.

Vary treatments across the batch.

Return a JSON object: { "items": [ ... ] }`;

const SOCIAL_POST_INSTRUCTIONS = `Generate {count} social media posts for ARTO Studio AI, ALL in {language}.

Each item is one POST IDEA published in three platform-specific variants. LinkedIn, Instagram, and Facebook each have their own optimal length, tone, and hashtag norms, so the SAME idea is rewritten three times in the same payload. The shape:

{
  "campaign_name": "4-8 word descriptive title for this campaign",
  "linkedin": { "hook": "...", "copy": "..." },
  "instagram": { "hook": "...", "copy": "...", "hashtags": ["..."] },
  "facebook": { "hook": "...", "copy": "..." },
  "cta_text": "...",
  "cta_url": "...",
  "image_brief": {
    "treatment": "silhouette" | "pleated_warm" | "frosted_glass" | "photographic_crop" | "poster_headline" | "bubbles_overlay" | "geographic_card" | "architectural",
    "text_overlay": null | "FRASE EN MAYÚSCULAS 4-8 PALABRAS",
    "wordmark": true | false,
    "geo_tags": true | false
  }
}

Per-network rules (mandatory):

LinkedIn (page post, professional)
- copy: 800-1500 chars. Narrative, declarative, gallery-text register. 2-4 short paragraphs. ONE line break between paragraphs (not two).
- hook: first 5-8 words. Loaded statement, not a question. Avoid "I'm excited to share" / "Thrilled to announce".
- Hashtags: 0-3 only, end of copy if at all. Never #ai #marketing #branding.
- CTA is appended as a separate line by the publisher.

Instagram (business profile, visual-first feed)
- copy: 80-220 chars. Tight, punchy, image carries the meaning. ONE clear thought.
- hook: first 5-8 words. Must stop the scroll without a question. Concrete + specific.
- hashtags: 3-7 distinct, RELEVANT hashtags as a string array. No generic spam (#ai #marketing #ux). Mix branded + niche.
- CTA: short ("Link in bio" or 3-5 word verb phrase).

Facebook (page post, conversational)
- copy: 200-400 chars. Conversational, slight warmth, can ask the reader something at the end (but NOT as the hook).
- hook: first 5-8 words. Declarative. No clickbait.
- Hashtags: 0-2 only.
- CTA appended as a separate line.

Shared
- campaign_name: a short descriptive title that identifies this campaign at-a-glance in the dashboard list. 4-8 words, sentence case (not all caps), in the same language as the post. Should summarize WHAT the post is about, NOT use the hook verbatim. Examples: "Discipline beats inspiration thesis", "Disciplina supera a la inspiración", "ARTO global presence across four cities", "3000 prompt catalog launch in Spanish". Avoid "The X campaign" / "Post about X" patterns.
- cta_text: 3-5 words. Examples: 'Browse the catalog', 'Try Brand Roast', 'Read the guide'.
- cta_url: one of /prompts, /pricing, /work, /roast, /learn, /learn/<slug>. NEVER external.
- Tone rules apply on all 3 variants (banned words list, tú-form Spanish, no AI tells, no em-dashes, no antithesis patterns).
- Lean into ARTO's concrete identity: 3,000 bilingual prompts, 15+ years with Google / Nike / Uber, methodology not motivation.

The 3 versions should clearly be the SAME idea, never invent a different topic per network. They should diverge ONLY in length, hashtag treatment, and register, not in substance.

IMAGE BRIEF — chosen by you, the writer.
Every social_post carries an image. Pick the visual treatment that fits the idea. ARTO has 8 treatments:

- silhouette: bold black silhouette character (eye-in-hand, eye-in-chest motif) on paper. Use for posts about people, craft, identity, or when copy is narrative and abstract.
- pleated_warm: warm-brown pleated motion-blur field. Use for posts about momentum, methodology, depth.
- frosted_glass: frosted glass plate over warm-brown ground. Use for conceptual / process posts.
- photographic_crop: tight sepia-warm photo (hands, objects, faces partially cropped). Use for posts about craft and tangible work.
- poster_headline: poster-scale Manrope Bold ALL-CAPS headline on paper. Use when the post has a strong, quotable claim. text_overlay MUST be set.
- bubbles_overlay: liquid / mercury glass bubbles cropping into the frame. Use for posts about energy, motion, surprise.
- geographic_card: editorial composition with NEW YORK / TORONTO / MEXICO CITY / MADRID corner tags. Use for posts about scale / reach / "the global agency that never sleeps".
- architectural: editorial grid with hairlines and black planes. Use for posts about systems, structure, methodology.

Also decide:
- text_overlay: a SHORT (4-8 words) ALL-CAPS phrase to render IN the image. Required for poster_headline. Optional (and often null) for other treatments. When set, must complement the post idea, NOT repeat the hook verbatim.
- wordmark: true to include the small italic-serif "arto" wordmark in a corner. Default true. Set false ONLY when the treatment already includes typography (geographic_card, poster_headline).
- geo_tags: true to include corner-pinned NEW YORK / TORONTO / MEXICO CITY / MADRID tags. Default false. Only set true for geographic_card OR for posts explicitly about ARTO's global presence.

Vary treatments across the batch. Three social posts in a row should not all be silhouette.
